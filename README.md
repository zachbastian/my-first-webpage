# This is the README file for My First Webpage.

Be aware, this page is a _work in progress_ and does not reflect (hopefully) where my final website making ability will be in **several months.**

Please notice:

1. The formatting
2. The links
3. The structure

Things I learned while creating this web page:

* How to use basic HTML
* How to structure a page
* How to use GitHub

[Use Google](http://www.google.com) to solve any problems you might encounter while coding.
